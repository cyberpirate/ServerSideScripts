Here are some scripts I use on my server



getip.sh

DESCRIPTION
I wrote this to notify me if my home server external
ip address changed, being dynamic and all. It uses
whatismyip.com's automation service to grab the ip
and compares it to the old ip to see if you should be
notified. The rules are you can't hit the page more
than every 300 seconds. Check this page for up to
date rules

http://www.whatismyip.com/automation/default.asp

I suggest placing it in cron.hourly

INSTALL
Edit the email variable in this one with the email you want to be notified by
make executable (chmod +x file)
Place in /etc/cron.hourly

TODO
There is a bug where it will sometimes email a new ip address even though it hasen't changed
  -Might have something to do with running while the internet is down then re-running after the connection has been regained
more ways to notify?



MagtoTor.sh

DESCRIPTION

Changes info hashes to magnet links and magnet links
to torrents. NOTE The torrents produced by this script
only work in rtorrent. It can print magnet links from
.infohash files in the watch directory or info hashes
passed to it from command line

INSTALL
edit watchdir variable
make it executable (chmod +x file)
copy to your $PATH or something

TODO
Maybe I will reorganize the script, otherwise its pretty much finished



Peerprotect.sh

DESCRIPTION
based on Peerprotect found here

http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Peerprotect

That script didn't work anymore so I updated
it to work with iblocklist. All this script
does is download the blocklist, and load it
into iptables. It also opens the port range
defined in the variables.

INSTALLATION
put it in some startup scripts
make sure to update once in a while (maybe a cron script?)

TODO
It's pretty much done at this point
